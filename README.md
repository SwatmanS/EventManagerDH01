# EventManagerDH01

We need to create a piece of software which will help the NGO manage their upcoming events. Our goal is not to advertise the events as we are merely developing a tool to make sure they are advertising in an easier and more efficient way ensuring that the screening. Our main goal is to help efficiently point out the areas that can help the Rose organisation can better advertise to the underprivileged communities with their already existing tools. We do this by helping the NGO manage the number of people coming to these events by predicating data from previous events to show an average number of people who are turning up to a single event. This information must be contained in a database with data which the NGO would a gained from previous events, this meaning we are not collecting the data ourselves making it more truthful and accurate to our NGO.
